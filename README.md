This is my school project that I need to do for finishing my final year of High school.
suggestions are wellcommed in issues tab.
how to use:
1st way: extract [Project.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19216428/Project.zip) and run exe.
2nd way: use visual studio to run project and build and run(?, not sure whats corect name).

warning, curently button for 4th spell crashes code because there are only 3 spells loaded(inside of work directory and then \test\*, anything inside will be read and if in correct format)
